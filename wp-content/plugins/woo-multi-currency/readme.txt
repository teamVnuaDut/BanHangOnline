### Important Notice:

- Plugin works based on WooCommerce 7.x plugin.

- To handle WP’s Conditional Tags, this plugin uses **eval()** which is very dangerous because it allows execution of arbitrary PHP code. Therefore, please only fill this field with proper conditional tags which are validated and/or provided by trusted developers.

- It is released on WordPress.org and you can use plugin as free to build themes for sale.

### MULTI CURRENCY FOR WOOCOMMERCE FEATURES

 - **Let customers see product prices in different currencies**: Use the Currency bar (manage in Design tab), Currency Price Switcher (manage this in General tab), or shortcode to let customers switch the currency.

 - **Pay in different currencies**: Enable this option to allow your customers to pay in different currencies

 - **Auto Detect**: Automatically detect a customer's country code based on IP address and display respective currency set for their country.

 - **Geo API**: Choose between WooCommerce and External service. If this option is set to WooCommerce, our plugin will geolocate IP from ipinfo.io or ip-api.com. If this option is set to External, our plugin will use [IP Geolocation](http://www.geoplugin.com/geolocation/) by [geoPlugin](https://www.geoplugin.com/). For more details, please read geoPlugin's [Privacy Policy and User Agreement](https://www.geoplugin.com/privacy).

 - **Display approximate price**: If you do not want the plugin to detect customer’s country and show the price in their native currency directly when they come to your store, WooCommerce Multi Currency can still show the price in default currency AND the approximate price in the customer’s native currency

 - **Set the exchange rate manually**: WooCommerce Multi Currency also allows you to set up the exchange rate manually.

 - **Manage the Exchange fee**: Every time you exchange money from one currency to another, the bank or money transfer operator may apply a currency exchange fee. The difference between the exchange rate they decide to apply and the real exchange rate traded in the market is the currency exchange fee. WooCommerce Multi Currency allows you to add permanent exchange fees to exchange rates.

 - **Set custom currency symbols**: You can add your custom currency symbols. Example: United States Dollar can be displayed as USD, US$, $…

 - **Set fixed price**: WooCommerce Multi Currency allows you to add fixed prices in different currencies to the product price. The fixed prices will overwrite the prices calculated by exchange rates.

 - **Hide Currency**: WooCommerce Multi Currency allows you to hide currencies that you do not want to be shown on the front-end.

### PREMIUM FEATURES

&#9658;All features from the free version.

 - **Unlimited currency**: with the premium version, you can add as many currencies as you want. With the free version, you can use 2 currencies only.

 - **Use SESSION**: Enable this option and the plugin will use the session instead of cookies to save the selected currency.

 - **Force a specific currency to Checkout**: Put a mandatory currency after customers click “Place order”

 - **Display multiple currencies**: If the product price on the Single product page and the Checkout page is not in the same currency, this option is helpful

 - **Price format**: you can create some rule to adjust final price to display beautifully for each currency such as $9.87 -> $9.99 ...

 - **Switch currency by JS**: with the free version, the plugin will add a tag to your URL to define the selected currency, yourwebsite.com/?wmc-currency=EUR for example. The switch currency by JS can help to switch currency without adding the tag to your URL.

 - **Select payment methods**: select which payment method is available with each currency. Other payment methods will be hidden in the checkout page.

 - **Multilingual support**: able to select which currency to be used for which language, currently support WPML and Polylang

 - **Bulk fixed price**: you can quickly add fixed price for every currency by importing them from a CSV file

 - **Change currency follow**: force currency to change to the one you configure for each country when customers change their billing/shipping country

 - **Update exchange rate automatically**: The plugin automatically updates exchange rates. You can set the time for the automatic update: every 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month.

 - **Select currency exchange rate APIs**: You can select to update the exchange rate from VillaTheme.com, Google Finance, Yahoo Finance. More exchange rate APIs will be added in the future.

 - **Receive update exchange rate email**: This option of WooCommerce Multi Currency allows the admin to receive a notification email whenever it updates the exchange rate.

 - **Premium support**: with each purchase, you will have 6 or 12 months of premium support from VillaTheme. Our developers will help if you have any problems with Multi Currency for WooCommerce.
